Python Set UP

Python used = anaconda

Scripts:
MOC.py - makes pics of MOC files
RMOC.py - makes pics of RMOC in density layers
RMOCT.py - makes pics of RMOC in temperature layers
MOC_parallel.py - for 10 + files please screen ipcluster (currently on mnemosyne) and run in parallel
RMOCT_parallel.py - as above.

Note Books:
For one instance please refer to the following notebooks:
Density Check (for checking density)
Spin up testing (in parallel and in progress)
Diagnostics (in progress)
MOC
MOCparallel
RMOC(temp)
Remapping (inprogress)
Remapping from layers (in progress)

To come:
Heat budget 1 (use model output for heat flux terms wolfe 2008)
Heat budget 2 ( Break down of heat fluxes as in master's year)
StreamwiseMOC (Integrate along streamlines)
StreamwiseHeat ( Int along streamlines heat budget 2)
